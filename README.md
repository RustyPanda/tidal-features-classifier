# Tidal Features Classifier
Classifies low surface brightness features with convolutional neural networks and other approaches.

This repository records the code used for the paper 'Identification of Low Surface Brightness Tidal Features in Galaxies Using Convolutional Neural Networks'. All code is by Mike Walmsley.

Code is provided as a reference for future work and for reproducibility **only**. We (Mike Walmsley) **strongly** recommend you do **not** attempt to use this code as-is for a new project. We  have subsequently rewritten clean, tested and extensible code with a similar purpose that we recommend instead; this new code will be published by mid-2019.

Should you, by some fortunate alignment of the stars, find this code useful, please cite the paper. A bibtex encoding will be added here following publication.

If you would like to get in touch, please email Mike Walmsley at mike.walmsley@physics.ox.ac.uk.
